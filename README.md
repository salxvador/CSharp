# C# and .NET Projects
These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework while at The Tech Academy


_Following this course, I participated in a 2-week live project for a theater company's website. You can learn about that [here](https://github.com/salxvador/TTA-CSharpProjects/blob/main/CodeSummary.md)_
## Projects:

### [BlackJack Game:](https://github.com/salxvador/TTA-CSharpProjects/tree/main/BlackJack)
##### This is the largest single project completed as part of this course. A fully-functional BlackJack console application that demonstrates abstraction, encapsulations, inheritance, and polymorphism.

### [Car Insurance Quote Generator:](https://github.com/salxvador/TTA-CSharpProjects/tree/main/CarInsurance)
##### This is an AASP.NET MVC application that generates fictional car insurance quotes given a set of inputs. The form gathers information about the insuree and the vehicle, then generates a price quote based on the logic in the insuree controller.

### [Code First EntityFramework:](https://github.com/salxvador/TTA-CSharpProjects/tree/main/CodeFirstNewDatabaseExample)
##### An example of using code-first architecture to create databases

#### There are many other projects in this repo that were created to explore the many facets of object-oriented programming in C#, and navigating the .NET framwork. They are named for the features that they expore.
