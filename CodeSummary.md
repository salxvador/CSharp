# Introduction
My final project at The Tech Academy comprised a simulated 2-week sprint in which we worked on a ASP.NET web application for a theater company. This included creating a data model for the theater's members using enity framework, and the corresponding create, read, update, and delete controllers and views for managing the stored data.

On the front end, I primarily used Bootstrap, custom CSS, and JavaScript to maintain a consistent color scheme and a visually pleasing look.
